

CHANGES IN THE 2.1 RELEASE
--------------------------
- Added CR padding support to PackedGSMCharset.
- Added CRCCPackedGSMCharset and CRSCPackedGSMCharset packed GSM variants with CR padding enabled.
- Added KZ-1048 charset, with aliases STRK1048-2002, RK1048, csKZ1048.
- Improved javadocs.




CHANGES IN THE 2.0 RELEASE
--------------------------
- Added 32 national variants of the ISO/IEC 646 charset.
- Moved GSM classes to separate sub-package.
- Changed UTF-7 decoding to be lenient in accepting trailing zero bits in shift sequences.
- Changed UTF7Charset.contains to reflect full Unicode equivalency.
- Added a command-line utility supporting file charset conversion.
- Added ByteLookupCharset.createTable utility method.
- Generalized createInverseLookupTableDefinition to Utils.toInverseLookupTableDefinition.
- Applied many refactorings, simplifications, clarifications and clean-ups.
- Applied various optimizations to encode/decode loops.
- Improved docs.




CHANGES IN THE 1.6 RELEASE
--------------------------
- Migrated to Maven build system, directory structure and artifact conventions.
- Added OSGi headers to jar manifest.
- Fixed javadoc errors when building with JDK 8.
- Improved javadocs and misc. minor refactorings.




CHANGES IN THE 1.5 RELEASE
--------------------------
- Fixed GSMCharset encoding of non-breakable space character (0x00A0), which shouldn't be encoded.
- Fixed PackedGSMCharset decoder edge case of handling overflow continuation for large strings (>256)
  when calling decoder directly (not via String methods).
- Fixed PackedGSMCharset decoder edge case of string size which is a multiple of internal buffer size (256)
  greater than 256 and has escaped characters on decoded buffer boundaries.
- Simplified CharsetProvider.charsetForName flow.




CHANGES IN THE 1.4 RELEASE
--------------------------
- Dropped support for JDK 1.4 and earlier.
- Added MIK charset.
- Added KOI8_U as a KOI8-U alias.
- Optimized EscapedByteLookupCharset encoding buffer allocation for strings with no escape chars.
- Added ByteLookupCharset.updateInverseLookupTable convenience method.
- Improved docs.




CHANGES IN THE 1.3 RELEASE
--------------------------
- Added X-roman8 as an hp-roman8 alias.
- Added the generic EscapedByteLookupCharset to simplify implementation of single-escape-byte charsets.
- Created two flavors of the GSM charset: CCGSMCharset (mapping the Latin capital letter C with cedilla)
  and SCGSMCharset (mapping the Latin small letter c with cedilla). See javadocs for details.
- Added support for Packed GSM charset, with the two flavors as well.
- Renamed the canonical charset name for the new GSM family, to make the flavor choices explicit.




CHANGES IN THE 1.2.1 RELEASE
----------------------------
- Fixed a combined JavaMail-JCharset bug that could cause an infinite loop on some inputs.
- Updated the ISO-8859-8-i/e mapping for the MACRON character.
  The incorrect mapping in the JDK's implementation of ISO-8859-8 is fixed as of JDK 1.5
  (see http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4760496). We now determine the
  running JDK version, and if it's JDK 1.5 or higher we use the correct mapping. This
  way we remain consistent with the running JDK ISO-8859-8 charset implementation.




CHANGES IN THE 1.2 RELEASE
--------------------------
- Added KOI8-U charset.




CHANGES IN THE 1.1 RELEASE
--------------------------

- Added ByteLookupCharset class to simplify implementation of single byte charsets.
- Added GSM-default-alphabet charset (used in SMPP).
- Added hp-roman8 charset.
- Added ISO-8859-8-i/e charset.
- Added ISO-8859-6-i/e charset.




CHANGES IN THE 1.0 RELEASE
--------------------------

- This is the first release of the Java Charset package.
